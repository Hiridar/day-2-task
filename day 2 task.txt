Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects ?

  The window object represents the browser window.
  The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.

  The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.

  Since the window object is the * Global object,
                                 * ergo,
                                 * it is the end of all scope chains,
                                 * you don’t have to explicitl specify it when accessing its properties…
                                 * Instead of window.setTimeout,
                                 * you can just write setTimeout
                                    Same goes with document… instead of window.document,
                                 * you can just write document…
